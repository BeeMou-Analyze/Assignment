### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In this EDA we would be trying to analyse the data shared by the client to get an insight into its business operations across the country. Hence, we would be answering questions like;
   1. What service line contributes majorly to the organisation's revenue.
   2. What Region contributes the most to the organisation's business.
   3. How as the business been performing over 2014 to 2015.
   4. How many stores does the business have in each market/region.
   5. E. What is the Average contribution per store/market etc.
   Through our understanding of this questions we hope to give the client insight on areas of forcus to enhance the business operations and improve its topline (revenue).

### Data Analysis
---
Through the data analysis I aim to prvide insight into the sales performance of the client's business in 2014 and 2015, identity trends/patterns and make data inferenced recommendation to help improve the top-line of the business.

From the data analysis below are the insights gathered:

1. Business Model
The business operates in all the six regions of the country and has the most market and stores in North east (8 and 39 respectively) and the least in the North central (2 and 8 reapectively).
The business operates four lines of business (printer sale, copier sale, Parts and Service Plan) across all its stores with Service plan contributin the bust to revenue year-on -year. The business operates on all day throught out the year but 94% of its sales are made during work days.

2. Sales By Region;  North East contributed the most in revenue N18.6 billion (25% of total revenue), followed by south west contributing N15.8 billion (22% of total revenue) and  North Central contributed the least of just N6.4 billion Naira (8% of total revenue). This understandable given that not central has just 2 markets and 8 stores in contract to the 8 markets and 39 stores in North East we can infer that the business its probably just opening up its market in North Central.
